### Team Members:

### Summary

A project aimed at implementing Generic Programming features as a design pattern in C, using pre-processor directives. This project involved the implementation of generic containers like list, stack, queue, vector, and hashmap, iterators for each of these containers, and generic algorithms like find, find_if, count, count_if, min, max, and accumulate that make use of these iterators. This project was developed and implemented as part of the Design Patterns Course during our Undergraduate Study.
